<hr>
Have you ever played the google chrome dino game? This is my own version of it, developed in rust using the WASM (web assembly) technology.

## Try on your brower

You can open this project in your browser using: https://google-dino-game.vercel.app/, but the vercel isn't configured to compile the wasm files, so for now, it isn't working

### Warn

I'm still developing the vercel compatibility, so you may found some issues

## Develop by your own

### My recomendations - Docker

If you want to develop your own version of this game, you should get docker installed, so you don't have to worry about configure anything or make shure that this will work on your machine, is everythig already configured for you. Besides, in a virtualized environment, errors like "it works on my machine" can be avoidable. I made this to be really simple to just "enter and use" with no need for configuration. <!--fuck the history that was deleted because of him, how could he do that with me?-->

### Start the server

To start the server, use: `run`, this command will make shure that everything necessary to make this project work is being executed and is working correctly.

## Todo

Those are some stuff that I think that would be cool to add in this project

* [ ]  Set the start time (day / night) of the game to the equivalent to the user's theme
* [ ]  Create a grid to prevent impossible situations for the player, making the game playable
* [ ]  Create a progression difficulty, making the game harder over time
* [ ]  Create a pause menu acessible with 'esc'
* [ ]  Add multplayer compatibility

I'm not using any libray, and this project is on a begginig stage, finishing this can take a long time

## History

I had a problem and needed to delete and create the repo again, so the history of this repo before '11 ago 2024' was deleted, but this afected just one week of progression.
