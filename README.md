Have you ever played the Google Chrome dino game? This is my own version of it, developed in Rust using the WASM (web assembly) technology.

## Develop by your own

### My recommendations - Docker

If you want to develop your own version of this game, you should get docker installed, so you don't have to worry about configuring anything or make sure that this will work on your machine, is everything already configured for you. Besides, in a virtualized environment, errors like "it works on my machine" can be avoidable. I made this to be really simple to just "enter and use" with no need for configuration.

### Start the server

To start the server, use: `run`, this command will make sure that everything necessary to make this project work is being executed and is working correctly.

## Todo

Those are some stuff that I think would be cool to add to this project

* [ ]  Create a grid to prevent impossible situations for the player, making the game playable
* [ ]  Create a progression difficulty, making the game harder over time
* [ ]  Add multiplayer compatibility
* [ ]  Save the user's progress if they close the page
* [ ]  Add moon cycle, with different sizes and textures
* [ ]  Add a God mode, make it contain infinite life, a custom texture for the dinosaur and enable double jump

I'm not using any library, and this project is in the beginning stage, finishing this can take a long time

## History

I had a problem and needed to delete and create the repo again, so the history of this repo before '11 ago 2024' was deleted, but this affected just one week of progression.
